Variables are used to store data.
=> In Js, there are 3 types of Variables
    |-> var 
    |-> let 
    |-> const 

Scope:
=> var is a GLOBAL scope variable 
=> let, const are BLOCK scope variables

Redeclaration  & Re-assignment:

        re-declaration    re-assignment
var         yes              yes 
let         no               yes 
const       no                no 

Question:
what happens if we use a variable without declaring?

Answer:
We can declare the variable again using var (Js-Hoisting concept).
Eg: 
a = 10;
var a;

But we can't declare the variable using let, const after assigning the value.
