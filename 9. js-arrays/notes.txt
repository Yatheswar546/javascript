Array:

-> A Data Structure that holds collection of heterogeneous datatypes.
-> Arrays are Mutable (changable).

Arrays Memory Representation:

let x = [1,2,3];
let y = x;

In the above example "x" array is created and y is referenced to that location.
But a NEW ARRAY is NOT CREATED for "y".

x[0] = 1000;

When we change value in x then y will also change.

NOTE: In arrays it will check for memory locations but not for actual values.

Array Methods:

array.length
array.at(index)
array.join('-')

array.pop()
array.push()
array.shift()
array.unshift()

old_array.concat(new_array);
old_array + ',' + new_array

array.slice(start,end) [start, end)
array.splice(position_to_add, no. of elements to be removed, new_element)

array.indexOf('word')
array.lastIndexOf('word')

array.includes('word');
